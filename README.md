# Matomo Dashboard Widget for PyroCMS

![Image showing how matomo dashboard widget for Pyro Cms looks](https://github.com/pixney/matomo_widget-extension/blob/master/matomo_widget-extension.png)

Extremely simple dashboard widget for pyrocms showing currently only two graphs from
Matomo: DeviceDetection and VisitsSummary.

It's mainly for personal use, but might be updated in the future for more advanced
usage.

Pull requests are more than welcome!

## Installation
